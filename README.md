# DEEP-LEARNING-PROJECT
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Model an output filtering system where high emotional 'inhibitory signals' can block the system from acting, similar to inhibitory neurons in the brain. Using emotion-labeled text data, block messages where negative emotions exceed a defined threshold. (Circadian Rhythm &amp; Alertness Prediction)
It is a project using CNN in deep learning to predict and analyze the negative inputs to return as positive outcomes.
For example:
In a biological neuron it reacts for any stimulus be it physically or mentally, Be it a hot iron rod or verbal abuse that may lead one to sadness and at extremity depressions. Considering these as negative inputs the projects aim is to convert this into positive outcomes as such inreality for sleep in some people, food for some other and a small talk for more..
These are the real time situations where people prevent the eternal negativity to be expelled.
This project aims to create one such neural network where negative inputs given to neuron (biologically hurtful things) to be converted to positive outcomes.
